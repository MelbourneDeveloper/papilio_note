# Papilio Note

This is the official sample app for the Flutter framework [papilio](https://pub.dev/packages/papilio). It covers navigation, state management, and composition (dependency management). Documentation about the framework and how I implemented it in this app is on its way. Meantime, you can check out the app in the browser directly [here](https://www.papilionote.com).
